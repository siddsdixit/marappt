## PRESS RELEASE

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**MARA AI Platform Launches, Enabling Any Business to Deploy Production AI in Minutes**

*New platform eliminates months of infrastructure work, allowing non-technical teams to build and deploy AI agents that automate business processes*

**DALLAS, TX – June 15, 2026** – MARA Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) today announced the general availability of MARA AI Platform, a revolutionary platform that enables businesses of any size to deploy production AI workloads in minutes—without infrastructure expertise, coding, or months of setup time.

The platform has already transformed how hundreds of enterprises approach AI, with customers reporting deployment times reduced from months to minutes, and cost savings of up to 95% compared to traditional cloud providers.

**"Every business leader knows AI will transform their industry, but most are stuck because deploying AI is too complex, too expensive, or requires teams they don't have,"** said Fred Thiel, CEO of MARA Holdings. **"MARA AI Platform changes that. We've removed every barrier—no coding required, no infrastructure to manage, no months of waiting. If you can use a spreadsheet, you can build an AI agent that automates your business processes."**

### What Customers Are Saying

Since launching six months ago, MARA AI Platform has been adopted by over 500 enterprises across industries, from Fortune 500 companies to fast-growing startups.

**"We automated our entire customer support operation in one afternoon,"** said Sarah Chen, VP of Operations at a leading financial services company. **"Our team built AI agents that handle 80% of support tickets automatically, with zero coding. The visual workflow builder made it so simple—our operations manager, who has no technical background, built the first agent herself. We're saving $2M annually in support costs while improving response times."**

**"The cost difference is staggering,"** noted James Rodriguez, CTO of a global logistics company. **"We were paying over $50M per year for AI inference on traditional cloud platforms. With MARA, we're paying under $1M for the same workload. That's a 98% cost reduction. And the platform is more reliable—we've had zero downtime in six months."**

**"We went from idea to production in 5 minutes,"** said Michael Park, Head of Product at a healthcare technology startup. **"We needed to automate patient intake forms, and our engineering team estimated it would take 3 months. With MARA AI Platform, our product manager built the agent in 5 minutes using the pre-built templates. We launched the same day."**

### The Problem MARA Solves

Enterprises face three critical barriers to AI adoption:

1. **Complexity**: Deploying AI requires months of infrastructure setup, model training, and deployment configuration—work that requires specialized engineering teams most companies don't have.

2. **Cost**: Traditional cloud providers charge $0.10+ per AI inference. At enterprise scale, this costs millions annually. Many companies can't justify the ROI.

3. **Accessibility**: Building AI systems requires coding and machine learning expertise. Business users who understand their processes can't build the AI solutions they need.

MARA AI Platform eliminates all three barriers through a unique combination of simplicity, cost efficiency, and accessibility.

### How It Works

MARA AI Platform provides three core capabilities:

**1. Visual AI Studio**  
A no-code, visual workflow builder that lets anyone create AI agents by dragging and dropping components. No coding required. Business users can build agents in minutes that would take engineering teams weeks to develop.

**2. Pre-Built Agent Templates**  
Hundreds of ready-to-use AI agent templates for common business processes: customer support, sales qualification, invoice processing, resume screening, workflow automation, and more. Customers can deploy these templates instantly and customize them to their needs.

**3. Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure**  
Built on MARA's unique hybrid compute infrastructure, the platform delivers AI inference at $0.002 per request—20x cheaper than traditional cloud providers—with 99.95% uptime and sub-200ms response times.

**"The magic is in the simplicity,"** said Fred Thiel. **"We've taken everything that makes AI deployment complex—infrastructure, coding, model training, deployment—and made it invisible. Customers just describe what they want to automate, and the platform handles the rest."**

### Real Customer Results

Customers are seeing dramatic results:

- **Deployment Speed**: 5 minutes vs. 3-6 months with traditional approaches
- **Cost Savings**: 50-95% reduction in AI infrastructure costs
- **Productivity Gains**: 30-80% reduction in manual work through automation
- **Time to Value**: Days instead of months
- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime vs. 99.5% industry average

**"We've automated processes that used to take our team 40 hours per week,"** said Lisa Thompson, Operations Director at a manufacturing company. **"Now those same processes run automatically 24/7, and our team focuses on higher-value work. The ROI was immediate."**

### Technical Excellence

MARA AI Platform is built on enterprise-grade infrastructure:

- **99.95% Uptime SLA**: Industry-leading reliability with automatic failover
- **Sub-200ms Latency**: Fast enough for real-time applications
- **SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR Compliant**: Enterprise security and compliance built-in
- **Unlimited Scale**: Handles everything from startups to Fortune 500 workloads
- **Global Infrastructure**: Deployed across multiple regions for low latency

**"Enterprise customers need reliability and security, not just low prices,"** said Fred Thiel. **"We deliver both. Our infrastructure is built for mission-critical workloads, with the same security and compliance standards that Fortune 500 companies require."**

### Market Impact

The AI infrastructure market is exploding, with global spending expected to reach $65B by 2027. MARA AI Platform is positioned to capture significant market share by making AI accessible to businesses that couldn't afford or deploy it before.

**"We're democratizing AI,"** said Fred Thiel. **"Right now, only the largest companies with big engineering teams can deploy AI at scale. We're changing that. Any business, of any size, can now deploy production AI. That's a massive market opportunity."**

### Pricing and Availability

MARA AI Platform is available now with three pricing options:

- **Pay-as-you-go**: $0.002 per AI inference (vs. $0.10+ on traditional platforms)
- **Enterprise Plans**: Starting at $10,000/month with volume discounts
- **Custom Plans**: For large enterprises with dedicated infrastructure

The platform includes a free tier for testing and development, with no credit card required.
